                        <div class="content"><p class="strong">My name is Alan Rooney and my current position is Deputy General Manager at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.</p>

<p>I first joined Tifco Hotel Group in August 2007 as part of the opening team in Crowne Plaza Dundalk. At this time I was beginning year 4 of my Hospitality Management degree. I always knew I was going to be a hotel general manager, and after doing some background research on the company behind the opening of this new hotel in Dundalk, I was sure that Tifco Hotel Group could present me with the perfect opportunity to realise my ambition.</p> 

<p>I joined the team as Food & Beverage Assistant in the hotel bar. From here I held further positions such as Conference & Banqueting Porter, Conference & Banquet Supervisor, Food & Beverage Supervisor, Duty Manager and Wedding & Events Co-ordinator. After 5 years at this property, an opportunity arose in Crowne Plaza Dublin - Blanchardstown. I applied for the position of Conference & Banquet Manager, and took up the position there in 2012. I was responsible for the day to day planning and operation of 12 busy meeting rooms with banqueting for up to 450 and conference facilities for up to 650. During my 4 years here, I also held the positions of Food & Beverage Manager and then finally Senior Manager. In April 2016, my next opportunity arose and I took up my current position as Deputy General Manager in Hilton Dublin Kilmainham.</p>

<p>What I like most about working in hospitality is the constant need to grow and evolve. It's true that no two days are the same, each day brings a new challenge and each challenge brings a new opportunity. In my experience, creating opportunities is something that Tifco Hotel Group excels at. The roles are challenging, but the personal reward is great. Growing with the company and having the opportunity to upskill at every corner is something that isn't easily found. There is a real emphasis on growing your own talent here, seeing a spark in somebody, helping them to realise that potential, and, ultimately, helping them to become future managers. A career in hospitality is rewarding, and the opportunities many. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what the future has in store for both myself and Tifco Hotel Group.</p>

                        <div class="content"><p class="strong">I am currently Reservations Manager at the 120 bedroom Hilton Dublin Kilmainham hotel. I moved to Ireland in 2008 after my studie at Budapest Business School in Hungary, faculty of Hotel Management. Before I first joined Tifco Hotel Groups I had been working with French hotel group, Accor as reservations agent in their 5* Sofitel and 4* Novotel brands in Budapest, and also gained experience as a call centre agent selling multiple properties.</p>

                        <p>I spent 4 years at the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport hotel. I started as reservations agent and I was lucky to have had the opportunity to grow my skillset and broaden my knowledge as receptionist, reception supervisor and later Reception Manager. I was lacking confidence before and the face-to-face contact with guests gave me the boost. When you put a smile on a customer’s face, that is the drive that keeps you going and makes you content with your job.</p>

                        <p>Shortly after Tifco Hotel Group had taken over the management of The Burlington Hotel, I decided to move back to reservations joining their team. Working in a 501-bedroom hotel is different in many ways, you have to function as part of a big team and specialize in certain tasks. When Hilton took over and the hotel started operating The Burlington Hotel as DoubleTree by Hilton Dublin Burlington Road, I begun looking after the group business. The changeover was my biggest challenge so far during my career due to its intensity and the workload. I’ve learnt the ins and outs of Hilton standards, and I had great role models from the hotel’s management team, as well as senior colleagues to become better at what I do. As the business was growing, so did our team. I was promoted to GCE Groups Executive and was supervising 2 other agents making sure that the hotel is achieving its rooms budget and assisting the GCE Team with all their conference room blocks.</p>

                        <p>The opportunity to become Reservations Manager at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham came before the next brand changeover at the ‘Burlo’, and I was looking forward to remain in the Hilton family and working with Tifco Hotels Group again. I’ve gotten tremendous support from the team and I enjoy inputting all the knowledge and skills I’ve gained over the years. I am encouraged to be innovative; we constantly work on different projects and apply new approach in order to reach our goal. It truly makes a difference when you are surrounded by great people at your workplace and at Tifco Hotels Group you always get the recognition for your achievements. It’s a great company to work with and I’m grateful to be part of it.</p>

                        <div class="content"><p class="strong">My name is Stephan Ernest and I am currently working as Deputy General Manager for the Award winning Crowne Plaza Hotel Dublin Airport as well as the Holiday Inn Express Dublin Airport. This year will be my 9th year with the Tifco Hotel Group, whom I joined in September 2008.</p>

                        <p>My hospitality education started early! I commenced my hospitality studies in Rotterdam, when I turned 15 years old and finished my Bachelor Degree in International Hospitality Management in Breda 6 years later.</p>

                        <p>I moved to Dublin straight after and started my professional career as a Junior Duty Manager in The Burlington Hotel. I spent 2 years working there, assisting the various departments, learning about daily operations, taking in the exciting hotel atmosphere and I loved every day.</p>

                        <p>When the Burlington hotel closed, I was given the opportunity to start my employment with The Crowne Plaza Hotel and Holiday Inn Express Dublin Airport as Assistant Conference & Banqueting Manager and I have not looked back since!</p>

                        <p>I remember the first few months in particular to be challenging for me. The learning curve was a steep one as it tends to be for most team members joining, but I found that the clients whom I looked after were pleased with my efforts and this gave me the confidence I needed to establish myself.</p>

                        <p>3 years after joining, I was promoted to the position of Restaurant Manager and shortly thereafter, I was asked to take up the role of Conference & Banqueting Manager given my previous experience in the department. What I found most rewarding in those days was to get the team working towards a common goal and the instant gratification of reaching that goal together.</p>

                        <p>I do sometimes wonder where I would be if I would have chosen a different path. Although it is impossible to answer this question, I truly believe that my time here has equipped me to successfully fulfil my role as Deputy General Manager and I look forward to many more years within the organization.</p>
