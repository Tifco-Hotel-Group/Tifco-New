                        <p>Tifco Hotel Group is one of Ireland's largest hotel groups with a portfolio of well known international brands, as well as several private labels. We are always looking for talented people who are driven and committed to delivering excellence in service.</p>

                        <p>We asked some of our team to Share Their Stories:</p>

                        <span>Alan Rooney</span></p>
                        <p class="profileBoard GrowDesc Grow">Alan [No Text] started in the hotel industry in 1982, graduating with honours from Shannon College of Hotel Management. Having worked for major hotels in the UK, Europe and North America in 1997 Enda opened the founding hotel of the Tifco Hotel Group; Clontarf Castle Hotel . Enda has been instrumental in the development and expansion of Tifco Hotel Group into what it is today, one of Ireland's largest hotel companies. He has been actively involved in the construction of new hotels, along with the acquisition and disposal of other Hotels. </p>
                        <p>I spent 4 years at the Crowne Plaza Dublin Airport hotel. I started as reservations agent and I was lucky to have had the opportunity to grow my skillset and broaden my knowledge as receptionist, reception supervisor and later Reception Manager. I was lacking confidence before and the face-to-face contact with guests gave me the boost. When you put a smile on a customer’s face, that is the drive that keeps you going and makes you content with your job.</p>

                        <p>Shortly after Tifco Hotel Group had taken over the management of The Burlington Hotel, I decided to move back to reservations joining their team. Working in a 501-bedroom hotel is different in many ways, you have to function as part of a big team and specialize in certain tasks. When Hilton took over and the hotel started operating The Burlington Hotel as DoubleTree by Hilton Dublin Burlington Road, I begun looking after the group business. The changeover was my biggest challenge so far during my career due to its intensity and the workload. I’ve learnt the ins and outs of Hilton standards, and I had great role models from the hotel’s management team, as well as senior colleagues to become better at what I do. As the business was growing, so did our team. I was promoted to GCE Groups Executive and was supervising 2 other agents making sure that the hotel is achieving its rooms budget and assisting the GCE Team with all their conference room blocks.</p>

                        <p>The opportunity to become Reservations Manager at Hilton Dublin Kilmainham came before the next brand changeover at the ‘Burlo’, and I was looking forward to remaining in the Hilton family and working with Tifco Hotels Group again. I’ve gotten tremendous support from the team, and I enjoy inputting all the knowledge and skills I’ve gained over the years. I am encouraged to be innovative; we constantly work on different projects and apply new approach in order to reach our goal. It truly makes a difference when you are surrounded by great people at your workplace and at Tifco Hotels Group you always get the recognition for your achievements. It’s a great company to work with and I’m grateful to be part of it.

                        <p class="profileBoard GrowDesc Grow">I am currently Reservations Manager at the 120 bedroom Hilton Dublin Kilmainham hotel. I moved to Ireland in 2008 after my studies at Budapest Business School in Hungary, faculty of Hotel Management. Before I first joined Tifco Hotel Groups I had been working with French hotel group, Accor as reservations agent in their 5* Sofitel and 4* Novotel brands in Budapest, and also gained experience as a call centre agent selling multiple properties.</p>

                        <span>Stephan Ernest</span></p>
                        <p class="profileBoard GrowDesc Grow">My name is Stephan Ernest, and I am currently working as Deputy General Manager for the Award-winning Crowne Plaza Hotel Dublin Airport as well as the Holiday Inn Express Dublin Airport. This year will be my 9th year with the Tifco Hotel Group, whom I joined in September 2008.</p>

                        <p>My hospitality education started early! I commenced my hospitality studies in Rotterdam, when I turned 15 years old and finished my Bachelor Degree in International Hospitality Management in Breda 6 years later.</p>

                        <p>I moved to Dublin straight after and started my professional career as a Junior Duty Manager in The Burlington Hotel. I spent 2 years working there, assisting the various departments, learning about daily operations, taking in the exciting hotel atmosphere and I loved every day.</p>

                        <p>When the Burlington hotel closed, I was given the opportunity to start my employment with The Crowne Plaza Hotel and Holiday Inn Express Dublin Airport as Assistant Conference & Banqueting Manager and I have not looked back since!</p>

                        <p>I remember the first few months in particular to be challenging for me. The learning curve was a steep one as it tends to be for most team members joining, but I found that the clients whom I looked after were pleased with my efforts and this gave me the confidence I needed to establish myself.</p>
                        
                        <p>3 years after joining, I was promoted to the position of Restaurant Manager and shortly thereafter, I was asked to take up the role of Conference & Banqueting Manager given my previous experience in the department. What I found most rewarding in those days was to get the team working towards a common goal and the instant gratification of reaching that goal together.</p>

                        <p>I was then given the opportunity to work as Operations Manager and Deputy General Manager to both hotels and I enjoyed my role.</p>

                        <p>I then moved to become General Manager at the Hendrick Hotel which was a new hotel about to open. after 2 very successful years here I moved back to become the opening General Manager of the Travelodge Dublin City Centre.</p>

                        <p>I absolutely love the company’s continuous striving to provide the best product for its customers. It creates a professional culture with pride in which all team members are given the opportunity to upskill and improve. I think that everybody looks for a workplace in which challenges provide rewards & growth and I am delighted to say that I found this working here at Tifco Hotel Group.</p>

                        <p>I do sometimes wonder where I would be if I would have chosen a different path. Although it is impossible to answer this question, I truly believe that my time here has equipped me to successfully fulfil my role General Manager and <p>I look forward to many more years within the organization.</p>
